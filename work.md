Currently I am COO and Head of Product at [Gauntlet](https://gauntlet.network), where we are building a financial modeling platform for crypto. We're an early stage company looking to grow so if you are passionate about our decentralized future, I encourage you to reach out.

I previously managed Fulfillment and worked as a PM for [Gigster](http://gigster.com) from 2015-2018, where I worked to allow anyone in the world to build software, quickly and easily.

Before that worked as a Program Manager at Microsoft from 2010-2014. Until 2013 I worked on Windows Apps and APIs, moving to  [Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us) after that. I have also worked freelance as a web designer and Developer. Below is a bit more info on a few of the products and projects I have contributed to.

I've included a few projects I've worked on below, but for my full work history, check out my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username }}) or [resume](/JohnMorrowResume.pdf).

## Product Management

### Gauntlet Platform

Gauntlet is a simulation platform for building financial models of blockchain protocols and applications. We integrate [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) contracts directly into our simulation environment to build accurate and robust models of smart contract behavior and incentives. Our platform is used to secure billions of dollars of digital assets.

### Windows Contacts APIs

![Contact APIs](/images/contactsapis.png)

I was the PM for the [Windows Contact Picker](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224913), and API and UI control which allows apps to access the user's address book information in a secure manner. This was awarded [a patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US8887092) in 2014.  Here's a [nice write up in Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/03/windows-8s-new-way-of-working-messaging-mail-and-people/) from when it was released in Windows 8 that has some more info as well. I continued work on the Contact APIs as one of the PMs who lead the design and development of the
[Contact Card](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.contacts.aspx)  in Windows 8.1.


### Microsoft HoloLens

When working on Hololens, I worked on a cross-team collaborative effort to deliver holographic video as part of the native Windows rendering pipeline. I also created and tested UI prototypes in Unity3D to gain validated learning about designs and interaction patterns.

## Development


### Gigster Data Warehouse

![Data Warehouse](/images/gigsterdata.png)

At [Gigster](https://gigster.com/), I designed and built out our data warehouse and analytics system. Using python scripts and Fivetran for ETL, we created a single source of truth for the company's data in Amazon Redshift. Then, using SQL and Looker, I created hundreds of different data views and visualizations that were used to drive day-to-day decision making across the company's hundreds of projects, thousands of freelancers, and millions in revenue.



### The Paper Trail

![The Paper Trail](/images/thepapertrail.png)

The Paper Trail was an online, audio-visual art project I worked on in collaboration with Chicago's [The Papers](https://thepapers.bandcamp.com/). The Papers collected videos from all around the world via [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1791710722/the-paper-trail-0) to go with their album, the Anyway EP.  I worked with them to combine their music and the submitted videos to create an experience we've called a "traveling album", where you can wander the world as you listen to their music. The site is no longer up, but you can view the designs I created [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vpCR-hM4rZkRykzY4o7uX65_FqUhIw8FZoImRH-kfAk/) and contact me if you are curious to learn more and/or see a demo.
